## Exploring the Relationship Between Different Software Dependencies and Blocking Bugs

### Here we describe each file or folder in the repository.
- [**DataSets**](https://gitee.com/hren_ron/dependency_analysis/tree/master/datasets) The datasets constructed in our study are presented in this folder, which were built from 13 open source projects, i.e., 4DIAC, Acceleo, ACTF, Ease, EclipseLink, EMF, EMFStore, JDT, Jubula, Mylyn, Papyrus, Sirius, and Virgo.
- [**Appendix.pdf**](https://gitee.com/hren_ron/dependency_analysis/blob/master/Appendix.pdf) A detailed introduction to some of the experimental methods and results in our study is presented in this document. It mainly includes the research methods of univariate logistic regression and confounding effects analysis, and detailed experimental results on hypothesis 2, hypothesis 3, and hypothesis 4 on RQ2 in our study.
- [**manual_analysis_result.csv**](https://gitee.com/hren_ron/dependency_analysis/blob/master/manual_analysis_result.csv) The results of our manual analysis of 260 blocking bug pairs are presented in the file, which include blocking bugs, blocked bugs, and software dependencies explicitly mentioned by developers on blocking bugs and blocked bugs.
